<h2 class="intro">Cricket World cup Final 2003</h2>
<p>Having won won 15 out of their 18 ODIs prior to the start of the tournament, defending champions Australia were called the "favourites" to win the title.Apart from the 1999 tournament, they had also won the title in 1987. India had won the competition once, in 1983. Prior to the World Cup, India lost an ODI series against West Indies at home, and were defeated heavily in a tour of New Zealand. Australia had won all the matches in tournament up until this point; India had won all their matches except the defeat to Australia in the group phase</p>
<p>Prior to this game, the two teams had faced each other eight times in World Cups; Australia had won six of these matches. A day before the final, Ponting had told the press that on crucial matches his team "tries to reach another level". The Indian fans' expectation on Tendulkar, the tournament's top-scorer, was quite high.</p>
